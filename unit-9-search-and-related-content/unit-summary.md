# Unit Summary

In this unit weâ€™ve covered different ways to let your visitors browse or search content. This can be done by creating views that directly query your database, by using the search tools bundled into GovCMS.

Managing your own search index gives you the chance to set your own biases for relevance and also provides faceted search interface to filter results. We used a bundled Lagoon Solr module, which is available in the GovCMS distribution.
