# Unit 2 Summary

In this unit we looked at the differences between the basic content types and how you can customise your own content types with additional fields. Most of the planning and work you’ll do on your site requires careful mapping out of content types, thinking about how they will be displayed on your site.

It’s also important to get your clients to test the content creation forms using real content to make sure the content types you designed model the data correctly and are flexible enough to be expanded.
