# Unit 3 Summary

In this unit we learned Media types in GovCMS and that managing Media types is very similar to Content Types - Media types provide a similar interface to manage fields, form widgets and display.

We learned that for the consistent display of images we should use Image Styles. We learned how to add a media field to a content type \(which can be applied to adding media fields to any other entity type, such as taxonomy terms, blocks or users\).
