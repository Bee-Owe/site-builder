# Site navigation

Menus are a collection of links \(menu items\) used to navigate a website. The core Menu UI module provides an interface to control and customise the menu system. Menus are primarily displayed as a hierarchical list of links. By default, new menu items are placed inside a built-in menu labelled **Main navigation**, but administrators can also create custom menus.

The GovCMS installation profile contains five menus:

1. **Administration** \(administrative task links\)
2. **Footer** \(site information links\)
3. **Main navigation** \(site section links\)
4. **Tools** \(user tool links, often added by modules\)
5. **User account menu** \(links related to the active user account\)

You can customise menus in the menu administration functionality by:

* Creating new custom menus
* Adding new menu items
* Reordering menu items by setting their "weight" or by dragging them into place
* Renaming menu items
* Changing the link title \(the tooltip that appears when you mouse over a menu item\)
* Moving a menu item into a different menu by editing its Parent property

A menu item will only be shown to a visitor if they have the rights to view the page it links to. For example, the admin menu item is not shown to visitors who are not logged in.
