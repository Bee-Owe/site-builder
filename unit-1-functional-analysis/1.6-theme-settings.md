# 1.11 Theme settings

GovCMS provides some basic configuration options to the site theme. For example, you may change the site logo, favicon, and control additional options.

To update theme settings, go to Appearance and click the **Settings** link next to the currently used theme.

Custom themes may provide a more advanced set of settings than those found in base themes.

#### **Exercise 1.11:** Change the logo

The GovCMS default layout includes a logo in the header of your site. In this exercise, we’ll change this logo. If you have a logo on your computer you can use that one. If not, find a sample logo on the internet that you can use for this exercise.

1. Go to **Appearance** and click the **Settings** link next to the “GovCMS 8 UI-Kit Starter 8.x-1.0-alpha1 \(default theme\)” theme
2. Unselect the “Use the logo supplied by the theme” checkbox, then use the **Upload logo image** button to upload the new logo
3. Click Save configuration

Now check what the logo looks like on the site. You can also go back to the theme configuration page to adjust the logo’s pixel width \(the height will adjust correspondingly\).
