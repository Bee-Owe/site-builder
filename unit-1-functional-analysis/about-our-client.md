# About our client

The current government jobs website is a static website, managed manually by a number of employees at a government agency. Job categories and individual pages require a manual update. The same content has to be updated in multiple places, to stay in sync across various sections of the site. This has led to incomplete and mismatching content.

A Google search widget allows job seekers to find jobs, but the search is lacking configuration and flexible styling. Your client wants to enhance the search functionality with facets, to facilitate easy filtering of search results.

As the number of jobs listed on the site has grown over time, managing the site has become difficult. The government agency that maintains the site has requested a new website and CMS and they have approached you as a site builder.
