# Define user stories

User stories are another way to find out more about your audience and ensure your website is designed to meet users’ needs. For site builders, you can create user stories for the end site visitors and for the people who will be working on the CMS \(backend\) to create the site \(e.g. Content Editors and Content Approvers\).

* As a job seeker, I want to be able to find a job I’m interested in so that I can apply online.
* As a Content Editor, I want to create and find content in one place so that I can do my job more efficiently.
* As a Content Approver, I want to see any content that’s waiting for my review/approval as soon as I login to the site so that I can review content quickly and easily.
