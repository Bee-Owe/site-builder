# Software and module requirements

## Software

* Depending on how the course has been set up, you will either be using remotely installed sites \(e.g. on the GovCMS Lagoon platform\), or you’re using a local installation \(on your computer\). If you’re working locally, we recommend using the GovCMS8 bundled development environment at: [https://github.com/govcms/govcms8-scaffold](https://github.com/govcms/govcms8-scaffold). A complete guide for installation is available at https://github.com/govCMS/govcms8-scaffold/blob/master/README.md
* You’ll also need a web browser with an inspection tool \(e.g. Firebug or Firefox\) - you can download Firebug here: [http://getfirebug.com](http://getfirebug.com/). You can also use Chrome’s “Developer tools” or Safari’s “Develop menu”.
* Finally, you’ll need a Lorem Ipsum generator extension such as this one: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dummy-lipsum/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dummy-lipsum/). You can add placement text, by right-clicking on the text area. ![A screenshot of a cell phone

## Modules

This course and manual are for GovCMS8, which contains most of the modules you’ll need to build a typical government website.

You can view the additional GovCMS8 modules in “composer.json file”: [https://github.com/govCMS/govCMS8/blob/1.x/composer.json](https://github.com/govCMS/govCMS8/blob/1.x/composer.json) - see the “require” section lists all “drupal/\[modulename\]” modules?

### Themes used:

GovCMS8 comes with a fully-featured base theme:

* GovCMS 8 UI-Kit Starter - based on UI-Kit theme - ships with GovCMS core
