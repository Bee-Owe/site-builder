# Glossary of terms



A complete list of Drupal terminology is listed on Drupal.org: [http://drupal.org/glossary](http://drupal.org/glossary)

| Block | Blocks are a method for positioning data within a page. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Book | A Drupal module to connect pages in a hierarchical sequence, perhaps with chapters, sections or subsections. |
| Contrib | The set of contributed modules shared on Drupal.org or any you select to use. |
| Core | Drupal default files and modules included with the project download. |
| d.o | Short for Drupal.org |
| Field | Fields are elements of data that can be attached to a node or other Drupal entity. Fields commonly contain text, image, or terms. |
| g.d.o | Short for Drupal.org |
| Input format | These are settings that define the filtering of user-entered text before it is displayed This can be used to control formatting or malicious input. |
| Menu | Refers to the navigation elements on a page, and to Drupal's internal system for handling requests. When a request is sent to Drupal, the menu system uses the provided URL to determine what functions to call. |
| Module | A module is a software \(code\) that extends Drupal features and functionality. Contributed modules can be downloaded from Drupal.org. They are not backward compatible. Modules for Drupal 6 will not work on Drupal 5. But often upgrade paths are available that don’t break data. |
| Node | A piece of content in Drupal, typically corresponding to a single page on the site, that has a Title an optional Body, and perhaps additional fields. Every node also belongs to a particular [content type](http://drupal.org/node/937) \[https://www.drupal.org/node/937\] for example polls, stories, and book pages. |
| Path | In Drupal terms, the path is the unique, last part of the URL for a specific function or piece of content. For instance, for a page whose full URL is http://example.com/?q=node/7, the path is node/7. |
| Path alias | This changes default paths such as node/7 into user-friendly paths such as about/contact. With certain modules these can be automated. |
| Permissions | Controls user access to content creation, modification and site administration at the application level in Drupal through roles. This also refers to security settings for files at the operating system level. |
| Taxonomy | Enables authorized users to categorize content using both tags and administrator-defined terms. |
| Template | A file that is mostly HTML with some special PHP code to substitute in values provided by an engine. |
| Users and Roles | Everyone using your site is a user with a user ID. The first user ID \(uid\) of a Drupal site \(uid=1\) automatically receives all permissions, no matter what role that user belongs to. Any anonymous user has uid=0. Users are assigned roles that control what they can do. For example ‘editor’ or ‘member’, and permissions can be set for those roles. |
| Views | Popular contributed module allowing site developers a simple graphical interface for modifying the presentation of content. Views permits selection of specific fields to display, filtration against various node attributes, choice of basic layout options \(ie. list, full nodes, teasers, etc.\), and other advanced details. |
| WYSIWYG | WYSIWYG is an acronym for What You See Is What You Get, used in computing to describe a method in which content is edited and formatted by interacting with an interface that closely resembles the final product. |
